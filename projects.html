                            This project is a game I worked on over the summer of 2020. It was created with the Unity Engine and coded in C#. 
                            The goal of the game is to survive as many rounds of zombies as you can. You are given a rifle, pistol, and knife as weapons 
                            to kill the zombies which spawn out of one of the two spawn areas. You are also able to upgrade your weapons by killing 
                            zombies, who give you money, and then spending it at the upgrade machine. The reason I made this project was to keep myself busy, 
                            teach myself several new skills, and create something my friends and I could play.

                            This project is a game I worked on over the winter of 2020. It was created with the Unity Engine and coded in C#. 
                            The goal of the game is to escape the planet you start on before time runs out or the meteors kill you. To escape you 
                            have to find the spaceship key which can spawn in random locations around the planet. Once you retrieve the key, 
                            you make your way back to the ship and take off. The reason I made this project specifically is because I believe it shows my
                            skills, I am fascinated with space, and making games is one of my biggest passions.

                            This project is a game I worked on over the summer of 2022. It was created with the Unity2D Engine and coded in C#. 
                            The goal of the game is to take out the all of the other player's pieces. There are four different piece types to choose 
                            from in the beggining of the game, with their own moves and stats as well as mana costs. Players are able to move multiple pieces 
                            as well as move the same piece multiple times, as long as they have mana to spare. The reason I made this project was to create a game I
                            always had an idea about and to be able to use this game to teach others in my game development club about making 2D games.

                            This project is a game I worked on over the fall of 2022. It was created with the Unreal 4 Engine and coded in C. 
                            This game is an inspiration from the flash game, Stick Wars, and the Steam game, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. 
                            It is a 3D tower defense game in which the player can fly around the battlefield and watch their army in action or 
                            take control of one of their own troops and manually moving them. The game ends when either the player's base or enemy's 
                            base is destroyed. The reason I made this project was as part of a school project with a friend but also as a combination 
                            of all of the techniques I've learned up until this point.
